# Mimic-React
To understand how the react works on base level by Creating a react like library on a very small scale. laying the foundation and learning and researching what needs to be done 

# The reactElement object in React can represent either a DOM element or a functional component. Here are the possible variations:

## DOM Elements: These are standard HTML tags like div, span, a, etc. They are represented as strings in the type field of a React element.
Example:
{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        className: 'my-class',
        children: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}

In this case, type is a string representing a HTML tag, props is an object containing properties that should be added to the HTML element, and children is the content inside the HTML element.

## Functional Components: These are user-defined components that are functions. They accept props as an argument and return a React element.
Example:

function MyComponent(props) {
    return {
        type: 'div',
        props: {
            children: props.text
        }
    };
}

{
    type: MyComponent,
    props: {
        text: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}


In this case, type is a function representing a React component, and props is an object containing properties that should be passed to the component.

## Children: The children prop can be a string, a number, a React element, or an array of any of these.
Examples:

### String or number:
{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        children: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}

### React element:
{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        children: {
            type: 'span',
            props: {
                children: 'Hello, world!'
            }
        }
    }
}

### Array of React elements:
{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        children: [
            {
                type: 'h1',
                props: {
                    children: 'Hello, world!'
                }
            },
            {
                type: 'p',
                props: {
                    children: 'This is a paragraph.'
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}


#### ----------function one ----------1 one is don eleements which is pretty normal , explain me second one and how tackel that one (functional one)----
The second type of reactElement is a Functional Component. In React, a functional component is a JavaScript function that returns a React element. It accepts an input (called "props") and returns what you want to render.

Here's an example of a functional component:
function MyComponent(props) {
    return {
        type: 'div',
        props: {
            children: props.text
        }
    };
}

In this case, MyComponent is a function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. The returned element is a div that contains the text passed in through props.text.

When you have a reactElement that represents a functional component, the type field of the reactElement will be the function itself. Here's an example:
{
    type: MyComponent,
    props: {
        text: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}

In this case, type is MyComponent, which is a function. To render this reactElement, you would call the function with the props as an argument, and then render the returned React element.

Here's how you might handle this in your customRender function:
function customRender(reactElement, container) {
    // If the type is a string, it's a DOM element
    if (typeof reactElement.type === 'string') {
        // ...create and append the DOM element as before...
    }
    // If the type is a function, it's a functional component
    else if (typeof reactElement.type === 'function') {
        const componentFunction = reactElement.type;
        const returnedElement = componentFunction(reactElement.props);
        customRender(returnedElement, container);
    }
}
In this code, if reactElement.type is a function, it calls that function with reactElement.props as an argument to get the returned React element. Then it calls customRender recursively with the returned element and the same container. This allows it to handle functional components.


#### ---------when will condition like that occour ? , like type:My Componenet ? , is this just like in real React js which has props which sends data to other componants ?-------------------------------------

Yes, exactly. The type: MyComponent scenario occurs when you're using a custom functional component in your React code.

In real-world React, you often break down your application into smaller, reusable pieces called components. These components can be either functional or class-based, but as per your request, we're focusing on functional components.

A functional component in React is just a JavaScript function that returns JSX. It can receive data from its parent component through props. Here's an example:
function MyComponent(props) {
    return <div>{props.text}</div>;
}

You can use this component in another component like this:

function App() {
    return <MyComponent text="Hello, world!" />;
}

In this case, MyComponent is a functional component that receives props and uses the text prop in its returned JSX.

When React sees <MyComponent text="Hello, world!" />, it translates it into a reactElement object that looks like this:
{
    type: MyComponent,
    props: {
        text: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}

Here, type is the function MyComponent, and props is an object with a text property. This is the same structure we've been discussing.

So, when you see type: MyComponent in a reactElement, it means that the reactElement represents an instance of the MyComponent functional component.



#### ok , but i didn't get one thing, here i'm defining the reactElement like this only, but in real react js what we do is , create a .jsx file in a src folder and then we define all the html jsx and logic of javascript in that file and then that file renders

 Yes, you're correct. In a real-world React application, you typically define components in separate .jsx or .js files, and these components return JSX syntax, which is similar to HTML.

For example, you might have a MyComponent.jsx file like this:
function MyComponent(props) {
    return <div>{props.text}</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;

And you might use it in an App.jsx file like this:

import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

function App() {
    return <MyComponent text="Hello, world!" />;
}

export default App;

When you write JSX in your components, Babel (a JavaScript compiler that's often used with React) compiles it into React.createElement calls, which return reactElement objects.

So, this JSX code:
<MyComponent text="Hello, world!" />

Gets compiled to something like this:
React.createElement(MyComponent, { text: 'Hello, world!' })

And React.createElement returns a reactElement object that looks like this:

{
    type: MyComponent,
    props: {
        text: 'Hello, world!'
    }
}
This is the same structure we've been discussing.

In your customReact.js file, you're manually creating a reactElement object that represents a DOM element. But in a real React application, you write JSX and let Babel and React handle the creation of reactElement objects.


#### ok so here is what i have to do what will be done in this project of mine is => first there will be jsx or that type of thing which will carry html elements and its all properties with values and attributes , then that will be complied into what what react has as React.createElement format and then that will be converted into what i'm using here in my code as reactElement , and then that will be processed through the what i wrote here as customRender function and then that will be injected into html and will be rendered into website !!?

Yes, you've got it! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Write JSX: You write your components using JSX syntax, which looks like HTML.

Compile JSX: Babel (or another transpiler) compiles your JSX into React.createElement calls.

Create React Elements: React.createElement creates reactElement objects, which represent your components and their props.

Render React Elements: Your customRender function takes these reactElement objects and turns them into actual DOM elements that can be displayed on a webpage.

Inject into HTML: The DOM elements are appended to a container element in your HTML, and they become visible on your website.

This is essentially how React works under the hood. It uses JSX and React.createElement to create a representation of your UI as reactElement objects, and then it turns these objects into actual DOM elements and updates the webpage. Your customRender function is doing something similar, but on a much smaller scale.
